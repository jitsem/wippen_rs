# Wippen_rs

A rust implementation of the Belgian game "Wippen". A rust 'engine' is compiled to wasm, and run in a simple html/js frontend.

## Todo
- Have an actual strategy for engine controlled player
- Decouple "players" from hardcode user/engine control. (eg. player 2 could also be user controlled)
- 'Animate' frontend based on event system
- A single game consist of multiple rounds, dealer switches position
- Have 'building' system like in actual wippen
